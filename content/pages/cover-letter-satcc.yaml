      - I am excited to apply for the Social Media and Marketing Consultant role for the SATCC to assist in the promotion of the SYA Program. My past experience in promotions at multiple levels has given me the skills and knowledge needed to excel in this position.
      - Currently as a Promotions Coordinator for Durham Radio I am responsible for managing and monitoring the Social Media accounts for multiple radio stations. I schedule and monitor the performance of different promotions and develop strategies to determine the best course of action for future plans. I also write promotional proposals for clients, plan and coordinate events, create contest graphics as well as author newsletter campaigns. In addition, I handle any other task needed to make our stationâ€™s promotions shine.
      - With over 8 years of experience communicating brand values I am confident in my ability to create excitement around the SYA Program. I believe programs like this are what help shape a province and make it stand out to prospective students who may or may not know what their future holds.
      - I am looking forward to moving back home to Saskatchewan. I hope it coincides with the chance to help Saskatchewan Youth, the future of my home province, find their career paths as part of the SATCC team.
